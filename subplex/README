"Subplex" gradient-free minimization code, based on a variant of 
Nelder-Mead simplex by Tom Rowan.

     T. Rowan, "Functional Stability Analysis of Numerical Algorithms", 
     Ph.D. thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas
     at Austin, 1990.  

This code was downloaded from Netlib.org, converted via f2c, and then cleaned
up a bit by Steven G. Johnson (stevenj@alum.mit.edu) for use with libctl.

Unfortunately, neither Netlib nor the Subplex source code contain any
indication of the copyright/license status of the code.  Arguably, anything
posted to Netlib absent such information was intended to be free of
restrictions.  However, it would be nice to have an explicit license!
