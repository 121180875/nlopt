NLopt 1.1 (28 October 2009)

* Added --without-octave and --without-matlab configure options to
  disable Octave and Matlab plugins, respectively.

* Modified COBYLA algorithm to have better support for bound
  constraints.

* Experimental support for nonlinear equality constraints via
  augmented-Lagrangian method.

* Support for compiling under Windows (ideally with MinGW) as a 
  DLL, although you have to manually add #define NLOPT_DLL
  to nlopt.h *after* installing (after compiling NLopt).

* Workaround for incompatible qsort_r functions in BSD and GNU libc
  by always using my own version; thanks to Wendy Vandoolaeghe
  and Philippe Preux for the bug report and explanation.

* Workaround for gcc 3.4.x conflict with HUGE_VAL definition in Solaris
  (gcc bug 19933).

* Better identification of Matlab-plugin installation directory.

* Fixed identification of Octave-plugin installation directory for
  recent Octave versions.

NLopt 1.0.1 (13 Nov. 2008)

* Allow user to override Matlab-plugin installation directory with
  MEX_INSTALL_DIR.

* Bug fix in my DIRECT code that prevented convergence (DIRECT-L unaffected).

* MLSL needs a nonzero default ftol_rel and/or xtol_rel to ensure that
  its local searches terminate; use roughly machine precision as defaults.

NLopt 1.0 (11 Nov. 2008)

* Initial public release.
