This is the NEWUOA software by M. J. D. Powell, which performs
derivative-free unconstrained optimization using an iteratively
constructred quadratic approximation for the objective function.  See:

	M. J. D. Powell, "The NEWUOA software for unconstrained
	optimization without derivatives," Proc. 40th Workshop
	on Large Scale Nonlinear Optimization (Erice, Italy, 2004).

The C translation by S. G. Johnson (2008) includes a few minor
modifications, mainly to use the NLopt stopping criteria (and to
take the objective function as an argument rather than a global).

The original Fortran code was released by Powell with "no restrictions
or charges", and the C translation by S. G. Johnson is released under
the MIT License (see the COPYRIGHT file in this directory).
