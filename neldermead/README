Nelder-Mead and variations thereof.  Possibly the algorithms:

-----------------

First, the original Nelder-Mead algorithm.

-----------------

Second, the provably convergent variant of Nelder-Mead described in:

	C. J. Price, I. D. Coope, and D. Byatt, "A convergent variant
	of the Nelder-Mead algorithm," J. Optim. Theory Appl. 113 (1),
	p. 5-19 (2002).

And/or possibly the (claimed superior) one in:
	
	A. Burmen, J. Puhan, and T. Tuma, "Grid restrained Nelder-Mead
	algorithm," Computational Optim. Appl. 34(3), 359-375 (2006).

-----------------

My own independent implemention of Tom Rowan's Subplex algorithm (a
more-efficient variant of Nelder-Mead simplex), which was described at:

     http://www.netlib.org/opt/subplex.tgz

     T. Rowan, "Functional Stability Analysis of Numerical Algorithms",
     Ph.D. thesis, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas
     at Austin, 1990.

I would have liked to use Rowan's original implementation, but its
legal status is unfortunately unclear.  Rowan didn't include any
license statement at all with the original code, which makes it
technically illegal to redistribute.  I contacted Rowan about getting
a clear open-source/free-software license for it, and he was very
agreeable, but he said he had to think about the specific license
choice and would get back to me.  Unfortunately, a year later I still
haven't heard from him, and his old email address no longer seems to
work, so I don't know how to contact him for permission.

Although I now have other derivative-free optimization routines in
NLopt, the subplex algorithm is nice to have because it is somewhat
tolerant of discontinuous and/or noisy objectives, which may make it a
good choice for some problems.

Tom Rowan expressed a preference that modified versions of his code
use a different name from "subplex".  Since this is a complete
from-scratch re-implementation, I figured that he would want a
different name too, so I am calling it "sbplx".
